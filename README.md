## Sistema de Recomendação Ze Delivery 

This repository contains the source code for a recommendation system designed to enhance the customer experience and increase sales for a food delivery platform. 

### Overview
The recommendation system leverages both collaborative filtering and content-based filtering to suggest products to customers based on their previous orders and interactions. This hybrid approach is designed to provide personalized and relevant recommendations that can improve customer satisfaction and drive sales.

### Key Features
- ** Collaborative Filtering: Uses historical order data and user preferences to identify patterns and suggest products.
- **Content-Based Filtering: Analyzes previous interactions to recommend items that are similar to those a user has engaged with.
- **User Interface: Offers a simple interface where users can view and interact with their personalized recommendations.

### Technical Details

The system is built using Python and utilizes the Pandas library for data manipulation and analysis. The recommendation engine is implemented using a collaborative filtering algorithm, specifically the Matrix Factorization algorithm. This algorithm decomposes the user-item interaction matrix into latent factors, which are then used to predict user preferences.

### Future Improvements
- **A lgorithm Enhancement: Explore more advanced recommendation techniques and combine multiple algorithms to further improve accuracy.
- **Data Expansion: Integrate additional historical data to enrich the training process of the model.
- **User Interface: Develop an interactive web-based interface for a more user-friendly experience.
