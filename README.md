## Ze Delivery Recommendation System

This repository contains the source code for a hybrid recommendation system designed to enhance the customer experience and boost sales for a delivery platform inspired by Zé Delivery.

### Overview
The recommendation system leverages both collaborative filtering and content-based filtering to suggest products to customers based on their previous orders and interactions. This hybrid approach is designed to provide personalized and relevant recommendations that can improve customer satisfaction and drive sales.

### Key Features
- Collaborative Filtering: Uses historical order data and user preferences to identify patterns and suggest products.
- Content-Based Filtering: Analyzes previous interactions to recommend items that are similar to those a user has engaged with.
- User Interface: Offers a simple interface where users can view and interact with their personalized recommendations.

### Technical Details

- Programming Language: Python
- Main Libraries:
    - Pandas for data manipulation and analysis.
    - Algorithms for collaborative filtering (e.g., Matrix Factorization) to decompose the user-item interaction matrix.
    - Matplotlib for data visualization.
- Hybrid Approach: Combines the strengths of collaborative and content-based filtering techniques to enhance recommendation accuracy.

### Future Improvements
- A lgorithm Enhancement: Explore more advanced recommendation techniques and combine multiple algorithms to further improve accuracy.
- Data Expansion: Integrate additional historical data to enrich the training process of the model.
- User Interface: Develop an interactive web-based interface for a more user-friendly experience.
