## Sistema de Recomendação Ze Delivery 

This repository contains the source code for a recommendation system designed to enhance the customer experience and increase sales for a food delivery platform. 

### Main Features

The system leverages collaborative filtering to recommend items to customers based on their past orders and preferences. It also incorporates content-based filtering, which suggests items based on the customer's past interactions with the platform.

### Technical Details

The system is built using Python and utilizes the Pandas library for data manipulation and analysis. The recommendation engine is implemented using a collaborative filtering algorithm, specifically the Matrix Factorization algorithm. This algorithm decomposes the user-item interaction matrix into latent factors, which are then used to predict user preferences.

The system also includes a user interface for displaying recommendations. This interface allows users to view their recommendations and interact with the system.

### Final Considerations

The system's performance can be further improved by incorporating more sophisticated recommendation algorithms and by expanding the data set.
